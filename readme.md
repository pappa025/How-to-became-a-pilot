#How to do your PPL?
### Milestone Project 1 - HTML/CSS Essentials (HTML, CSS)

This project is the first time when im spreading my wings on the Software Developement world.
The aim of this Project is to Design an interactive Front-End web application using HTML and CSS based on the principles of user experience design, accessibility and responsivity.

I've choosen  the topic of aviation for this project, as I'm flying Single Engine aircraft in a friendly Club at Weston (EIWT) Airport. This project summarizes the most important steps how to obtain your PPL (Private Pilot License).
I've also made a detailed page of the 3 most common and widely used training aircrafts (C-152, C-172, Piper Warrior). If you've ever been in any General Aviation airport, for sure you've seen few of them! I've collected on the Resources page the most widely used links for daily flight-planning. These links could be very useful in the future as they can be the base of the Club's webpage I'm planning to do.

The webpage divided to three pages, accessible thrugh the Navbar on the top of the page.
