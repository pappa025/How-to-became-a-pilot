            <h2>Training</h2>
            <p>All training activities only can take place at Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) approved Clubs and Flight Scools. The structure obtaining your Private Pilot License (PPL) is very similar all around the World, here in Ireland we use EASA syllabus for that!</p>
            <p>It starts with theoretical studies, after you have have to make exams at IAA from all Subjects</p>
            <p>The fun part comes when you're allowed to operate the aircraft and do the first few landings with your instructor!</p>
            <p>When you're instructor thinks you're ready, he will sign you off for your first Solo Flight!</p>
            <p>Not long after you'll find yourself preparing for the Test Flight, where you need to to show what you've learned for an IAA Examiner Pilot!</p>
            <p>With a succesful check-ride, you will have you Private Pilot License!</p>
