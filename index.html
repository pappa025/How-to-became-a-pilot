            <h2>First Steps to your PPL</h2>
            <p>The first step in your bumpy journey to be a private pilot is to get yourself to a nearby airstrip and
                take a trial lesson. A trial lesson will give you a good idea what you can expect. It is also a good
                opportunity to ask your flying instructor questions about the different routes to obtaining your goal.
                These lessons are available all over the country from larger training organizations like National Flight
                Centre and Atlantic Training Academy to local smaller flying clubs. Some of the Flying clubs are
                Designated Training Organizations (DTOs) who can facilitate your jour training towards your Private
                Pilot License (PPL). All above PPL level needs to be done at an Approved Training Organization (ATO).

            <h2>The Medical</h2>
            <p>Though there are three types of medical available in Europe (Class 1, Class 2 and LAPL (light Aircraft
                Pilot License), for your PPL you will need Class 2 towards CPL (Commercial Pilot License) Class 1
                medical. These medicals taking place in an Aeromedical Centre (like at Mater Private Hospital or Charter
                Medical Group in Dublin). When you pass your medical you’ll need to keep it valid by renewing it each
                year. The renewal is simpler and quicker than the initial. ECG’s, Hearing tests and Eye tests are
                conducted every few years depending on your age. Despite popular belief, pilots can wear glasses and the
                exact requirements can be found in a document called EASA Part-Med </p>

            <h2>Private Pilot License</h2>
            <p>Actual flying begin eventually! This is the time when you learn the basic aircraft handling, flying your
                first solo and cross country flight (at least 150 nautical miles) after you’ve passed 9 multiple choice
                exams in the subjects Air Law, Operational Procedures, Performance, Navigation, Aircraft Technical
                Knowledge, Principles of Flight, Communications, Meteorology and Human Performance & Limitations. All
                exams carry a pass mark of 75%. A General Flight Test with an Irish Aviation Authority Examiner then
                needs to be passed to obtain your PPL. If all went well you can fly all over Ireland with your newly
                obtained license!</p>
