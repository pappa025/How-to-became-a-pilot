            <h2>First Steps to your PPL</h2>
            <p>The first step in your bumpy journey to be a private pilot is to get yourself to a nearby airstrip and
                take a trial lesson. A trial lesson will give you a good idea what you can expect. It is also a good
                opportunity to ask your flying instructor questions about the different routes to obtaining your goal.
                These lessons are available all over the country from larger training organizations like NFC and AFTA to
                local smaller flying clubs.

            <h2>The Medical</h2>
            <p>Though there are three types of medical available in Europe (Class 1, Class 2 and LAPL (light Aircraft
                Pilot License), for your PPL you will need Class 2
                medical. These medicals taking place in an Aeromedical Centre (like at Mater Private Hospital. When you
                pass your medical you will need to keep it valid by renewing it each
                year. The renewal is simpler and quicker than the initial. Despite popular belief, pilots can wear
                glasses!</p>

                first solo and cross country flight (at least 150 nautical miles) after you have passed 9 multiple
                choice
                exams at the IAA. the whole trasining ends with a General Flight Test with an Irish Aviation Authority
